My portfolio includes several projects that I have worked on and are 100% owned by me.
FFT_Portfolio is a 2D game that I have been making in Unity. Within the file I have included a separate folder for the scripts.
IntelliX is a coding language that I have been writing in C++. The read me file includes an example of how to run the code.
StocksRaspberryPi is written in Python and fetches stock data from yahoofinance and then passes a prompt and instructions to chatGPT/openAi to generate videos analyzing stocks.
PitchHeatmaps is made in Unity and creates a simulation for real world pitches that I pulled from baseball savant. When you select a pitch it randomly selects a location based on the corresponding heatmap and throws that pitch with the specified movement profile.
