# Brooklyn Mayberry Portfolio
My portfolio includes several projects I have worked on, and they are 100% owned by me.


## FFT_Portfolio 
is a 2D game I have been making in Unity. I have included a separate folder for the scripts within the file.
## IntelliX 
is a coding language that I have been writing in C++. The Read Me file includes an example of how to run the code.
## StocksRaspberryPi
is written in Python and fetches stock data from Yahoo Finance and then passes a prompt and instructions to ChatGPT/openAI to generate videos analyzing stocks.
## PitchHeatmaps 
is made in Unity and creates a simulation for real-world pitches that I pulled from Baseball Savant. When you select a pitch, it randomly selects a location based on the corresponding heatmap and throws that pitch with the specified movement profile.
